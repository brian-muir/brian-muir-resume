::: concise
-Direct the development, implementation, and presentation of the financial forecast for $10B in annual medical and pharmacy claim expenses across 26 state products using mixed-models regression.

-Lead a team of six actuaries and data analysts working on a wide range of analytics projects encompassing interactive claims dashboards using Rshiny and RMarkdown, advanced forecasting methods, SQL database creation and maintenance, and ad-hoc deep dive analyses for multiple business partners across Actuarial, Finance, Sales, Product, Policy, Medical Management, Pharmacy, and Marketing. 

-Present findings to leadership on member-segmented variances to forecast, financial impacts of COVID cost and deferral of services, and deep-dives into claims trends during monthly CFO financial briefings.

-Developed a member-level gross margin database detailing revenue and expense components across 40 targetable member characteristics that integrates disparate data sources using SQL/R. Deployed overlaying drill-down dashboard in RSConnect used widely across departments to identify risks and opportunities for member-segmented business actions.

-Identified an $8M annual initiative to improve on risk adjustment code capture of Hemophilia that we continue to support with outreach targets via an in-production Shiny Dashboard.

-Created stratified med-management model based on interacting the two dimensions of utilization and health status to highlight top conditions, disease management status/acceptance, risk score, risk adjustment code capture opportunity, claim costs and demographics by segment to identify optimal cohorts for med management programs.
